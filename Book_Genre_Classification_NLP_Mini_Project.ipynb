The first part is told by Patience White, a woman of considerable means compared to others in her town. Her father died and left her enough money that she would not have to marry to be cared for. She lives with her brother and his wife and children, in a room she has to herself, something her sister-in-law Martha considers an unnatural privilege. Patience paints Biblical scenes as a pastime, and helps Martha with the children sometimes. They do not get along well. Patience has known of Sarah Dowling for a while since Sarah is a scandalous character to some, wearing pants and doing men's work. Sarah has a family of sisters and her father trained her to do men's work since he had no sons. Intrigued one day when Sarah delivers firewood to the White household, and to flout Martha, Patience invites Sarah into her part of the house and socializes with her. Sarah divulges that she plans to set out by herself and go west and buy her own farm. Not having the heart to tell her that she will not have the opportunity to do it, Patience indulges Sarah and tells her she wants to come along. In the midst of planning the trip west, Sarah admits she feels for Patience, and although too aware of the danger, Patience also admits her attraction for Sarah. Sarah returns to her much poorer home, where she lives with her large family in a one-room cabin. She tells her sister Rachel that she's going west with Patience as her mate, and Rachel, upset by being replaced to go west by Patience, tells their father who beats Sarah, then drags her to Patience's home to demand to know the nature of their relationship. Faced with having to admit their acts in front of witnesses, Patience denies she feels anything for Sarah and that it was all a game. The narrative switches to Sarah's perspective as she cuts off all her hair, renames herself \\\"Sam\\\", takes an axe and walks west alone, healing from the beatings her father gave her (no harm meant, he says). After a few experiences that demonstrate the risks of freedom, Sam takes up with a traveling Parson who goes town to town selling books in a horse-drawn rig he sleeps in. He teaches Sam to defend himself against boys in towns, to cook, teaches him about the Bible and other cultures, but most importantly, teaches him to read. In time, Parson admits he's attracted to Sam and when he tries to seduce Sam, Sarah admits her true identity. Away about six months, Sarah heads home again as Parson heads towards New York, his home. Patience arrives the next day to casually invite her to Sunday dinner. Sarah accepts, and their relationship starts again after Patience admits she lost her courage. They carry on their relationship, Sarah visiting Patience on Sundays, sometimes bringing a sister or her mother, but when they are caught embracing with their bodices open by Martha, Patience's brother tells them it's time for them to go. They head to New York City with brother Edward's blessing. Thinking Sarah is lower-class, a man on the ship assaults her, but Patience rescues her and teaches her the necessary points of being a lady. They lodge with the captain and in their first locked room alone, consummate their relationship. They meet up with the Parson again and decide that upstate New York in Greene County will be their destination, where land is cheap and they can live in peace. They arrive in Greene County and they negotiate the purchase of a small farm, plant their crop and begin their life together.\",\n          \" A skeleton has been unearthed. Soon the body is identified, and the horrific discovery hits the headlines . . . Fourteen-year-old Graham Marshall went missing during his paper round in 1965. The police found no trace of him. His disappearance left his family shattered, and his best friend, Alan Banks, full of guilt. That friend has now become Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and he is determined to bring justice for Graham. But he soon realises that in this case, the boundary between victim and perpetrator, between law-guardian and law-breaker, is becoming more and more blurred...\",\n          \" The widow Mildred Finster has been a fan of \\\"cozy\\\" mystery novels for years. At the age of seventy-one she decides she would like to become a real private detective. She finds a business card for Angel Investigations and likes the name. Team Angel is busy with its own personal problems, and has little time to deal with Mildred offering her services. Later a truckload of valuable antiquities is stolen and they assume a simple theft. The arrival of ruthless killers from afar soon gets the attention of the gang. They must cope with being followed everywhere by a well-meaning old lady, fight off poltergeists, and try to set aside their personal differences (at least temporarily) so that they can overcome the supernatural foe which is responsible for a centuries-old mystery.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The first part is told by Patience White, a woman of considerable means compared to others in her town. Her father died and left her enough money that she would not have to marry to be cared for. She lives with her brother and his wife and children, in a room she has to herself, something her sister-in-law Martha considers an unnatural privilege. Patience paints Biblical scenes as a pastime, and helps Martha with the children sometimes. They do not get along well. Patience has known of Sarah Dowling for a while since Sarah is a scandalous character to some, wearing pants and doing men's work. Sarah has a family of sisters and her father trained her to do men's work since he had no sons. Intrigued one day when Sarah delivers firewood to the White household, and to flout Martha, Patience invites Sarah into her part of the house and socializes with her. Sarah divulges that she plans to set out by herself and go west and buy her own farm. Not having the heart to tell her that she will not have the opportunity to do it, Patience indulges Sarah and tells her she wants to come along. In the midst of planning the trip west, Sarah admits she feels for Patience, and although too aware of the danger, Patience also admits her attraction for Sarah. Sarah returns to her much poorer home, where she lives with her large family in a one-room cabin. She tells her sister Rachel that she's going west with Patience as her mate, and Rachel, upset by being replaced to go west by Patience, tells their father who beats Sarah, then drags her to Patience's home to demand to know the nature of their relationship. Faced with having to admit their acts in front of witnesses, Patience denies she feels anything for Sarah and that it was all a game. The narrative switches to Sarah's perspective as she cuts off all her hair, renames herself \\\"Sam\\\", takes an axe and walks west alone, healing from the beatings her father gave her (no harm meant, he says). After a few experiences that demonstrate the risks of freedom, Sam takes up with a traveling Parson who goes town to town selling books in a horse-drawn rig he sleeps in. He teaches Sam to defend himself against boys in towns, to cook, teaches him about the Bible and other cultures, but most importantly, teaches him to read. In time, Parson admits he's attracted to Sam and when he tries to seduce Sam, Sarah admits her true identity. Away about six months, Sarah heads home again as Parson heads towards New York, his home. Patience arrives the next day to casually invite her to Sunday dinner. Sarah accepts, and their relationship starts again after Patience admits she lost her courage. They carry on their relationship, Sarah visiting Patience on Sundays, sometimes bringing a sister or her mother, but when they are caught embracing with their bodices open by Martha, Patience's brother tells them it's time for them to go. They head to New York City with brother Edward's blessing. Thinking Sarah is lower-class, a man on the ship assaults her, but Patience rescues her and teaches her the necessary points of being a lady. They lodge with the captain and in their first locked room alone, consummate their relationship. They meet up with the Parson again and decide that upstate New York in Greene County will be their destination, where land is cheap and they can live in peace. They arrive in Greene County and they negotiate the purchase of a small farm, plant their crop and begin their life together.\",\n          \" A skeleton has been unearthed. Soon the body is identified, and the horrific discovery hits the headlines . . . Fourteen-year-old Graham Marshall went missing during his paper round in 1965. The police found no trace of him. His disappearance left his family shattered, and his best friend, Alan Banks, full of guilt. That friend has now become Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and he is determined to bring justice for Graham. But he soon realises that in this case, the boundary between victim and perpetrator, between law-guardian and law-breaker, is becoming more and more blurred...\",\n          \" The widow Mildred Finster has been a fan of \\\"cozy\\\" mystery novels for years. At the age of seventy-one she decides she would like to become a real private detective. She finds a business card for Angel Investigations and likes the name. Team Angel is busy with its own personal problems, and has little time to deal with Mildred offering her services. Later a truckload of valuable antiquities is stolen and they assume a simple theft. The arrival of ruthless killers from afar soon gets the attention of the gang. They must cope with being followed everywhere by a well-meaning old lady, fight off poltergeists, and try to set aside their personal differences (at least temporarily) so that they can overcome the supernatural foe which is responsible for a centuries-old mystery.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.\\nMeanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these \\\"shining girls\\\" are the luckiest alive\\u2014until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.\\nBut the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come.\\nWritten with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the \\\"wonder\\\" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\",\n          \"From the New York Times bestselling author of the Pucked series comes a romantic comedy about instant attraction, second chances, and not-so-little white lies.\\n\\nSometimes I need an escape from the demands, the puck bunnies, and the notoriety that come with being an NHL team captain.

Even better, she has absolutely no idea who I am.\\n\\nLainey is the perfect escape from my life. My plan for seclusion becomes a monthlong sex fest punctuated with domestic bliss. But it ends just as abruptly as it began. When I\\u2019m called away on a family emergency, I realize too late that I have no way to contact Lainey.\\n\\nA year later, a chance encounter throws Lainey and me together again. But I still have a lie hanging over my head, and Lainey\\u2019s keeping secrets of her own. With more than lust at stake, the truth may be our game changer.

              "' Drowned Wednesday is the first Trustee among the Morrow Days who is on Arthur\\'s side and wishes the Will to be fulfilled. She appears as a leviathan/whale and suffers from Gluttony. The book begins when Leaf is visiting Arthur and they are discussing the invitation that Drowned Wednesday sent him. Arthur had been admitted to hospital because of the damage done to his leg when he attempted to enter Tuesday\\'s Treasure Tower. Suddenly, the hospital room becomes flooded with water as the two are transported to the Border Sea of the House. Leaf is snatched away by a large ship with green sails, known as the Flying Mantis, while Arthur remains in his bed. When the Medallion given him by the immortal called the Mariner apparently fails to summon help, Arthur is without hope. Eventually, a buoy marking the pirate Elishar Feverfew\\'s treasure floats toward him. As soon as Arthur opens it, his hand is marked with a bloody red colour. Arthur now has the Red Hand, by which Feverfew marks whoever has found his treasure, so that he can identify them later. Not long after, a scavenging ship called the Moth rescues Arthur. On board, Arthur (going by the name of Arth) is introduced to Sunscorch, the First Mate, and to Captain Catapillow. Their journey brings them through the Line of Storms and into the Border Sea, where they are later pursued by Feverfew\\'s ghostly ship, the Shiver. The damage inflicted on the Moth is serious; therefore Sunscorch commands an Upper House Sorcerer, Dr. Scamandros, to open a transfer portal to elsewhere in the Secondary Realms. Scamandros claims that Arthur is carrying something that interfered with his magic, and tells Sunscorch to throw him overboard. As a last resort, Arthur shows them the Mariner\\'s Medallion, which stops Scamandros saying that they must get rid of Arthur. After going through the transfer portal (with Arthur\\'s help), the ship is grounded on a beach. When Arthur wished to learn what happened to Leaf, Dr. Scamandros applies his sorcery to make it possible. She is revealed to be aboard the ship Flying Mantis. Arthur joins Catapillow for supper, later to reveal his identity. At first, Propaganda issued by Dame Primus (Arthur\\'s Steward) makes them skeptical of this, but they eventually become convinced. A few days later, Wednesday\\'s Dawn takes Arthur to meet Wednesday for her \\'luncheon of seventeen removes\\'. As they approach, Wednesday shrinks into her human form to meet Arthur. During their lunch, Wednesday tells Arthur that after Part 3 of the Will has been released, she will surrender the Third Key to Arthur. Arthur is then taken by Wednesday\\'s Dawn to a place called the triangle in search of his friend Leaf. He learns that Leaf has been forced to work on the Mantis, but is otherwise intact. Arthur later makes a deal with the Raised Rats, a group of anthropomorphic rats brought to the House by the Piper, to take him to Feverfew\\'s hideout, which they believe is inside a miniature world located within Drowned Wednesday\\'s stomach. On the Raised Rats\\' ship, Arthur opens a gift from Dr. Scamandros, which proves to be a golden transfer watch. With this, he communicates with and rescues Dr. Scamandros. He then uses a scrying mirror Dr. Scamandros gave him to watch Leaf. A rat watches him during the scry, and later saves him from a battle with Feverfew. Later, the Rats bring Arthur onto their submarine, where he meets with Suzy Turquiose Blue. In contrast to Suzy\\'s former cockney attitude, she has assumed a more \"ladylike and proper\" demeanor on the orders of Dame Primus. Only when they are no longer on the Border Sea, but under it, does she resume her customary ways of speech and dress. They are, with navigational difficulty, able to enter the stomach of Lady Wednesday and the worldlet therein. There, Arthur and Suzy, disguised as rats, find escaped slaves, professed followers of the Carp. These exiles take them to the Carp, who is the third part of the Will. They are halted in their attempt to escape by Feverfew, who proposes that each of them will try to kill the other by means of one strike only. Arthur fails his first try, then dodges Feverfew and severs his head. Leaf, who is Feverfew\\'s prisoner, then kicks it into a mud puddle containing Nothing, which consumes it. Upon his death, the worldlet begins to collapse. Via the Moth, Arthur and all his friends (with the exception of the reluctant Catapillow) are able to escape. Lady Wednesday recovers from her gluttony, then dies as a result of being poisoned by the worldlet, which had opened a void to Nothing. Arthur, now Duke of the Border Sea, appoints Sunscorch as his Noon and Scamandros as his Dusk. fr:Mercredi sous les flots th:พุธเพชฌฆาต'"

        "The distribution of summary lengths is **highly right-skewed**, meaning most book summaries are relatively short, but a few are extremely long. Over 75% of summaries have fewer than 474 words, and 50% fall below 200 words, showing a strong concentration in the lower range. The mean length is 377 words, but this is inflated by a small number of very long summaries, with the maximum reaching 5663 words. The high standard deviation (~454) reflects this variation. These outliers could impact NLP preprocessing steps and model training, making text length normalization or truncation important for consistency."

            " Drowned Wednesday is the first Trustee among the Morrow Days who is on Arthur's side and wishes the Will to be fulfilled. She appears as a leviathan/whale and suffers from Gluttony. The book begins when Leaf is visiting Arthur and they are discussing the invitation that Drowned Wednesday sent him. Arthur had been admitted to hospital because of the damage done to his leg when he attempted to enter Tuesday's Treasure Tower. Suddenly, the hospital room becomes flooded with water as the two are transported to the Border Sea of the House. Leaf is snatched away by a large ship with green sails, known as the Flying Mantis, while Arthur remains in his bed. When the Medallion given him by the immortal called the Mariner apparently fails to summon help, Arthur is without hope. Eventually, a buoy marking the pirate Elishar Feverfew's treasure floats toward him. As soon as Arthur opens it, his hand is marked with a bloody red colour. Arthur now has the Red Hand, by which Feverfew marks whoever has found his treasure, so that he can identify them later. Not long after, a scavenging ship called the Moth rescues Arthur. On board, Arthur (going by the name of Arth) is introduced to Sunscorch, the First Mate, and to Captain Catapillow. Their journey brings them through the Line of Storms and into the Border Sea, where they are later pursued by Feverfew's ghostly ship, the Shiver. The damage inflicted on the Moth is serious; therefore Sunscorch commands an Upper House Sorcerer, Dr. Scamandros, to open a transfer portal to elsewhere in the Secondary Realms. Scamandros claims that Arthur is carrying something that interfered with his magic, and tells Sunscorch to throw him overboard. As a last resort, Arthur shows them the Mariner's Medallion, which stops Scamandros saying that they must get rid of Arthur. After going through the transfer portal (with Arthur's help), the ship is grounded on a beach. When Arthur wished to learn what happened to Leaf, Dr. Scamandros applies his sorcery to make it possible. She is revealed to be aboard the ship Flying Mantis. Arthur joins Catapillow for supper, later to reveal his identity. At first, Propaganda issued by Dame Primus (Arthur's Steward) makes them skeptical of this, but they eventually become convinced. A few days later, Wednesday's Dawn takes Arthur to meet Wednesday for her 'luncheon of seventeen removes'. As they approach, Wednesday shrinks into her human form to meet Arthur. During their lunch, Wednesday tells Arthur that after Part 3 of the Will has been released, she will surrender the Third Key to Arthur. Arthur is then taken by Wednesday's Dawn to a place called the triangle in search of his friend Leaf. He learns that Leaf has been forced to work on the Mantis, but is otherwise intact. Arthur later makes a deal with the Raised Rats, a group of anthropomorphic rats brought to the House by the Piper, to take him to Feverfew's hideout, which they believe is inside a miniature world located within Drowned Wednesday's stomach. On the Raised Rats' ship, Arthur opens a gift from Dr. Scamandros, which proves to be a golden transfer watch. With this, he communicates with and rescues Dr. Scamandros. He then uses a scrying mirror Dr. Scamandros gave him to watch Leaf. A rat watches him during the scry, and later saves him from a battle with Feverfew. Later, the Rats bring Arthur onto their submarine, where he meets with Suzy Turquiose Blue. In contrast to Suzy's former cockney attitude, she has assumed a more \"ladylike and proper\" demeanor on the orders of Dame Primus. Only when they are no longer on the Border Sea, but under it, does she resume her customary ways of speech and dress. They are, with navigational difficulty, able to enter the stomach of Lady Wednesday and the worldlet therein. There, Arthur and Suzy, disguised as rats, find escaped slaves, professed followers of the Carp. These exiles take them to the Carp, who is the third part of the Will. They are halted in their attempt to escape by Feverfew, who proposes that each of them will try to kill the other by means of one strike only. Arthur fails his first try, then dodges Feverfew and severs his head. Leaf, who is Feverfew's prisoner, then kicks it into a mud puddle containing Nothing, which consumes it. Upon his death, the worldlet begins to collapse. Via the Moth, Arthur and all his friends (with the exception of the reluctant Catapillow) are able to escape. Lady Wednesday recovers from her gluttony, then dies as a result of being poisoned by the worldlet, which had opened a void to Nothing. Arthur, now Duke of the Border Sea, appoints Sunscorch as his Noon and Scamandros as his Dusk. fr:Mercredi sous les flots th:พุธเพชฌฆาต\n",

        "test_summary = \"In the small, isolated town of Black Hollow, nestled deep in the foggy mountains, an ancient evil stirred silently beneath the surface. The townsfolk had always whispered about the old Marwood estate, a sprawling mansion abandoned for decades, its windows dark and lifeless, its walls covered in creeping ivy and peeling paint. Locals claimed that anyone who dared enter never returned, though no official record ever confirmed the disappearances. Some said it was haunted by the spirits of the Marwood family, who vanished mysteriously one stormy night a century ago; others believed a darker, more malevolent presence lurked in the shadows, waiting patiently for the next unsuspecting victim.It was during the autumn festival, when the air was crisp and the trees were tinged with fiery reds and golds, that a group of friends, drawn by curiosity and the thrill of danger, decided to explore the mansion. Among them was Clara, a young journalist eager to make a name for herself, determined to uncover the truth behind the town’s most infamous legend. Accompanying her were David, a history student fascinated by the Marwood family’s mysterious disappearance; Sophie, a skeptic who laughed at the stories but secretly feared they might be true; and Ethan, a photographer eager to capture the mansion’s eerie beauty.As the friends approached the estate, the wind howled through the skeletal branches, carrying with it a chill that seemed unnatural. The mansion loomed before them like a dark sentinel, its ornate gates rusted and creaking as though warning them to turn back. Ignoring the unease gnawing at their nerves, they stepped inside, flashlights piercing the oppressive darkness. Dust motes swirled in the cold air, and the faint smell of decay permeated every corner. The walls were lined with portraits of stern-faced Marwoods whose eyes seemed to follow the intruders, and the floorboards groaned underfoot as if the house itself were alive, resenting their presence.At first, the exploration seemed uneventful, merely a collection of cobwebbed rooms and broken furniture. But as night fell, strange occurrences began to unfold. Whispered voices echoed down the hallways, fleeting shadows darted across walls, and the temperature dropped suddenly in certain rooms, leaving the friends shivering and unnerved. Clara’s journalistic instincts urged her to document everything, but even she could not ignore the growing sense of dread that clung to the mansion like a living thing.In the library, they discovered a hidden door behind a massive bookcase. Prying it open revealed a narrow staircase descending into the depths below. Compelled by a mixture of fear and fascination, they descended into the darkness, finding themselves in a cavernous cellar lined with shelves containing jars of unidentifiable substances and strange symbols etched into the stone walls. At the center of the room was a large, blackened hearth, and above it, an ornate mirror that seemed to shimmer unnaturally in the flashlight beam. As they stepped closer, the reflections in the glass began to twist, showing fleeting images of faces not their own—faces twisted in agony, mouths open in silent screams, eyes wide with terror.A sudden gust of wind slammed the door behind them shut, plunging the friends into complete darkness. Panic set in, and they fumbled to reopen the door, but it would not budge. From the shadows, a low, guttural growl emerged, followed by the sound of footsteps circling them, though no one was visible. One by one, strange visions overtook them: David saw his own face contorted in fear, Sophie glimpsed shadowy figures whispering her name, and Ethan’s camera captured fleeting images of creatures with hollow eyes and elongated limbs lurking just beyond the light. Clara tried to keep them together, but the mansion seemed intent on separating them, its corridors twisting impossibly, leading them in circles and into rooms that seemed to shift and change as they moved.Time became meaningless. Hours—or was it minutes?—passed as they struggled to find a way out. The walls themselves seemed to breathe, pulsing and contracting as if the mansion were feeding on their terror. Whispers escalated into screams, echoing from the ceiling, the floor, the very air around them. Clara’s flashlight flickered and died, leaving them in oppressive darkness, with only the unrelenting sound of their own panicked breathing.Then, in the blackness, they saw it: a figure emerging from the shadows, tall and impossibly thin, draped in tattered black robes that seemed to absorb the light. Its face was featureless, a blank void, yet somehow they felt its gaze piercing directly into their minds, probing for fear. One by one, it approached them, and the air grew thick with a suffocating sense of despair. The friends tried to run, but the mansion would not release them, corridors stretching infinitely, doors vanishing into solid walls.Clara, driven by desperation and courage, remembered the mirror in the cellar. Racing back, she smashed it with a heavy candlestick, shattering the glass into countless fragments. The figure recoiled, screaming an otherworldly wail that shook the foundations of the mansion. The walls trembled and cracked, dust raining down, and the friends stumbled back toward the staircase that now seemed to lead them upward. As they ascended, the mansion groaned and shifted, almost as if it were alive and enraged.Bursting through the front doors into the cold night air, they collapsed on the overgrown lawn, gasping and shaking, the first rays of dawn cutting through the fog. Behind them, the mansion sat silently, inert once more, as though it had been waiting for their escape all along. They never spoke of the events again, and the town’s whispers continued, growing only more sinister with each passing year. But in the darkest hours of the night, when the wind moaned through the trees, each of them could still hear the faint, almost imperceptible whispers calling their names, promising that the mansion had not forgotten—and that one day, it would claim them again.\"\n",

        "   \"In the small, isolated town of Black Hollow, nestled deep in the foggy mountains, an ancient evil stirred silently beneath the surface. The townsfolk had always whispered about the old Marwood estate, a sprawling mansion abandoned for decades, its windows dark and lifeless, its walls covered in creeping ivy and peeling paint. Locals claimed that anyone who dared enter never returned, though no official record ever confirmed the disappearances. Some said it was haunted by the spirits of the Marwood family, who vanished mysteriously one stormy night a century ago; others believed a darker, more malevolent presence lurked in the shadows, waiting patiently for the next unsuspecting victim.It was during the autumn festival, when the air was crisp and the trees were tinged with fiery reds and golds, that a group of friends, drawn by curiosity and the thrill of danger, decided to explore the mansion. Among them was Clara, a young journalist eager to make a name for herself, determined to uncover the truth behind the town’s most infamous legend. Accompanying her were David, a history student fascinated by the Marwood family’s mysterious disappearance; Sophie, a skeptic who laughed at the stories but secretly feared they might be true; and Ethan, a photographer eager to capture the mansion’s eerie beauty.As the friends approached the estate, the wind howled through the skeletal branches, carrying with it a chill that seemed unnatural. The mansion loomed before them like a dark sentinel, its ornate gates rusted and creaking as though warning them to turn back. Ignoring the unease gnawing at their nerves, they stepped inside, flashlights piercing the oppressive darkness. Dust motes swirled in the cold air, and the faint smell of decay permeated every corner. The walls were lined with portraits of stern-faced Marwoods whose eyes seemed to follow the intruders, and the floorboards groaned underfoot as if the house itself were alive, resenting their presence.At first, the exploration seemed uneventful, merely a collection of cobwebbed rooms and broken furniture. But as night fell, strange occurrences began to unfold. Whispered voices echoed down the hallways, fleeting shadows darted across walls, and the temperature dropped suddenly in certain rooms, leaving the friends shivering and unnerved. Clara’s journalistic instincts urged her to document everything, but even she could not ignore the growing sense of dread that clung to the mansion like a living thing.In the library, they discovered a hidden door behind a massive bookcase. Prying it open revealed a narrow staircase descending into the depths below. Compelled by a mixture of fear and fascination, they descended into the darkness, finding themselves in a cavernous cellar lined with shelves containing jars of unidentifiable substances and strange symbols etched into the stone walls. At the center of the room was a large, blackened hearth, and above it, an ornate mirror that seemed to shimmer unnaturally in the flashlight beam. As they stepped closer, the reflections in the glass began to twist, showing fleeting images of faces not their own—faces twisted in agony, mouths open in silent screams, eyes wide with terror.A sudden gust of wind slammed the door behind them shut, plunging the friends into complete darkness. Panic set in, and they fumbled to reopen the door, but it would not budge. From the shadows, a low, guttural growl emerged, followed by the sound of footsteps circling them, though no one was visible. One by one, strange visions overtook them: David saw his own face contorted in fear, Sophie glimpsed shadowy figures whispering her name, and Ethan’s camera captured fleeting images of creatures with hollow eyes and elongated limbs lurking just beyond the light. Clara tried to keep them together, but the mansion seemed intent on separating them, its corridors twisting impossibly, leading them in circles and into rooms that seemed to shift and change as they moved.Time became meaningless. Hours—or was it minutes?—passed as they struggled to find a way out. The walls themselves seemed to breathe, pulsing and contracting as if the mansion were feeding on their terror. Whispers escalated into screams, echoing from the ceiling, the floor, the very air around them. Clara’s flashlight flickered and died, leaving them in oppressive darkness, with only the unrelenting sound of their own panicked breathing.Then, in the blackness, they saw it: a figure emerging from the shadows, tall and impossibly thin, draped in tattered black robes that seemed to absorb the light. Its face was featureless, a blank void, yet somehow they felt its gaze piercing directly into their minds, probing for fear. One by one, it approached them, and the air grew thick with a suffocating sense of despair. The friends tried to run, but the mansion would not release them, corridors stretching infinitely, doors vanishing into solid walls.Clara, driven by desperation and courage, remembered the mirror in the cellar. Racing back, she smashed it with a heavy candlestick, shattering the glass into countless fragments. The figure recoiled, screaming an otherworldly wail that shook the foundations of the mansion. The walls trembled and cracked, dust raining down, and the friends stumbled back toward the staircase that now seemed to lead them upward. As they ascended, the mansion groaned and shifted, almost as if it were alive and enraged.Bursting through the front doors into the cold night air, they collapsed on the overgrown lawn, gasping and shaking, the first rays of dawn cutting through the fog. Behind them, the mansion sat silently, inert once more, as though it had been waiting for their escape all along. They never spoke of the events again, and the town’s whispers continued, growing only more sinister with each passing year. But in the darkest hours of the night, when the wind moaned through the trees, each of them could still hear the faint, almost imperceptible whispers calling their names, promising that the mansion had not forgotten—and that one day, it would claim them again.\"\n",
